# Computer Project - Assignment

# Requirements:
1. Please access the following sample application - http://computer-database.herokuapp.com/computers
2. Create a series of manual test cases that cover the CRUD operation plus the edge cases. Make sure you give detailed instructions for each test case (pre conditions, steps, expected results). You can use any format you want.
3. Write scripts that would automate the manual test cases that you see fit to be included in a regression test set. You can use any scripting language and tools you want.
4. When the assessment is completed, please push the file containing the manual test cases and the automation project to github and provide us a link to the repository.

# Test Scenarios:
1. The Manual Test Scenarios folder contains the test scenarios which created for this assignment.
2. The computers folder contains the automated test cases.

# Notes:
Out of scope because of time limitation the following:
1. Log & reporting of test results
2. Multi-browser testing
3. Responsive design testing
4. Checking the alignment of the elements and design of the application
5. No technical documentation provided so assumptions made for the validations checks
6. Possibly more automated test cases can be created
